1.walthrough we use phase noise to describe the noise performance of VCO, 
we should transfer it to jitter if the VCO followed by an ADC

2.The phase noise need to be minimized because the strong interferer due to reciprocal mixing will
overlap the desired signal and corrupt it.  if the phase nosie can be compressed enough, the corruption will be negnigible.
Even without interferer, high phase noise of LO will corrupt the signal itself.
