design is layout.
post simulation 
stress : leakage,  floating nodes --> leakage(invertor input is VDD/2 cause current)

1.N-well OD(oxide diffusion)_25/OD_33 space rule:


2.poly rule:rotation should be the same. especially for below 65nm process
poly need dummy


3.matching rule: common centroid, always follow stupid rule. 
current flow should be matched,can not in different directions(in every MOS)--> use even number fingers
space between guide ring and device should be the same(1um/2um rule)
avoid odd number devices(avoid 3X3)
from local to local, die to die, lot to lot

4.waive layer rule:
DRC rule

digital not over design, or produce large glitch
power down switch should made weak, large res, low current. or fuse
large current block should have seperate GND trace.
