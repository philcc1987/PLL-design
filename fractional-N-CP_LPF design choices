Summary

I. for BLE
1.PLL for BLE need low loop BW because the two ports modulation require good close-in noise performance,
and low current consumption lead to large C1 and C2.
2.Fractional-N type ask for perfect nonlinearity, require less than 2% CP current mismatch, so introduce I_offset
to improve the PFD/CP transfer function linearity is necessary.(in this case, the current mismatch converted to phase variation)
3.The duration of I_offset is defined by the phase excurtion due to Delta sigma action.

II. for Wi-Fi
1.Pll for wifi usage need high loop BW because the EVM require good fan-out noise performance, and lead to high CP 
current in case of too large R1 which generate large thermal noise.
2.Fractional-N may ferther exacerbate the noise budget. In order to maintain the phase error, Large CP current lead to large 
I_offset, introducing more current noise from the current source.

III.common considerations
1.The C2 in LPF should not be too small for two reasons:
(1)the parasitic cap(about 10fF~50fF) of long metal trace betwwen CP_out and LPF_in will be merged into C2
which may harm the stability of the loop.
(2)the coupling caps(50fF~100fF) between power lines and LPF will introduce noise. 
Too small C2 may lead to large splite noise voltage on LPF, which derectly input to VCO.
so the reasonable value should be around 1pF~2pF.
2.The RC filter in third order LPF should be tuned to achieve optimum noise suppression to delta sigma action.
3.Place the C1 on top of the R1 is better because of 0 DC voltage applied on R1.
4.The on resistance of switches used in programmable LPF is about 100ohm.(too low value lead to large size)
